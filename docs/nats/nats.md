## NATS

We make use of [UnityNats](https://github.com/barantaran/UnityNATS) to handle multiplayer connections and the transfer of data.

[NATS](https://nats.io/) is high-performance, extremely lightweight messaging system which makes use of subscribers and publishers roles.\
A client can publish messages with a subject on the Nats messages bus, Other clients can subscribe on such subjects and recieve all messages with these subjects.\
For local development we have created a [docker container](../docker/docker.md) which runs nats on port **4222**.

To connect with the nats messages service you need to hav an ip.
For local development we use nats://localhost:4222.
If you run nats somewhere else you will need its ip.

To increase performance of our game and networking we predefined messages.

All of our messages make use of a [BaseMessage](./messages/BaseMessage.md)

Whe have split up all of our messages: Client side and Host side. \

## Issue:
During the development of the game we came across a problem.
If we want to build the game as a webgl version it is not possible to use the NATS library that we are currently using.
This library makes use of a TCP connection with an external NATS instance.
Due to security reasons webgl build do no support TCP connection and we have to work around this.
Due to time limitations we did not work on any of these solutions and just build the game for Windows but to make the 
game more accessible we want to build it for webgl.

A couple solutions are:

- TCP -> HTTP/Websocket Proxy.\
    What you can do is make a Proxy that proxies all the TCP calls to either an HTTP request or a Websocket connection.
  (NOTE) If you want to make the Websocket proxy you need to configure the NATS instance in the cloud environment to [accept websocket connections](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/websocket/websocket_conf).
- Find another library (that makes use of the right .NET version).\
    We have looked into other libraries but the biggest issue is that this is one of the few libraries that support unity's .NET version.
    Maybe in the future the .NET version gets updated or there will be another library that supports Websocket/HTTP connections.
